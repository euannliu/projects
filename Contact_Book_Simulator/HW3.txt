1b) "break 14" and "break 7"
1c) 1) Integer i begins at "0", and the program multiplies "num" with "i", making "num" equal zero. 
	This will cause the condition in the for loop to return false due to "i", now being value 1, being greater than "num", which is now 0.
	2) break 14, break 7, r, c, print i  print num, break 8, print i
	
	changed line 7:
		for(unsigned int i = i; i < num; i++)
	
1d) 1) Integer "num" is always increasing due to always being multiplied by "i".
		Since "i" is always greater than zero, the for loop will seemingly never end.
		2) break 8, r, c, c, c, c, print num, print i
		added in the factorial function:
			int size = num; //line 7
			retur num; //line 11
